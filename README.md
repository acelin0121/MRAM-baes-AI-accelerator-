In AI hardware accelerators, storing neural network weights efficiently is critical for performance, energy efficiency, and area optimization.
Both MRAM and DRAM offer different trade-offs in this context. Here’s a comparison focused on their application in storing AI model weights, especially under PPA (Power, Performance, Area) constraints.

MRAM for AI Weight Storage – Advantages:
-Non-volatile storage: Weights are retained even when power is off, ideal for edge AI devices requiring instant-on and persistent models.
-Low standby power (Power): Since no refresh is needed, MRAM dramatically reduces idle and leakage power.
-High endurance: Suitable for inference workloads with frequent reads and less frequent updates.
-On-chip integration: Can be integrated into logic processes, enabling tight coupling with compute cores, reducing access latency.
